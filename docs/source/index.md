# mxmake

*mxmake* [mɪks meɪk] generates a project-specific Makefile by using an extensible library of configurable Makefile snippets.

It targets the development environments for Python packages but may be used outside of this playground.

*mxmake* is using *[mxdev](https://github.com/mxstack/mxdev)* to manage Python versions and project-related python package repositories.
For details on *mxdev* read its documentation.

In addition to the Makefile, *mxmake* also creates helper scripts for development, such as scripts for testing.
